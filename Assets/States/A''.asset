  storyText: "The aircraft crashing was a bit bizarre. Everything going black and
    you waking up in a middle of a god damn forest. That's not something that happens
    to you every day. And how the hell you even survived that crash. You were flying
    at a speed of 1350 km/h. That's not a speed number a human should be able to
    survive. And the weirdest part of all this was you were outside of the plane,
    lying at least  20 feet away from the aircraft. Judging by the damage of the
    plane, there is no way you should be able to survive that. Your mind was racing.
    Suddenly you decided to look around, the area is filled with trees (As you expect
    from a forest ). But the trees were kinda big, idk you are maybe thinking too
    much. Suddenly you heard some noise from the Bushes\n\n1. Go towards the noise
    \n\n2. Try to find something to protect yourself "
